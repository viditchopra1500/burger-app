 It is a small react.js web app in which we can make our custom burger and after ordering the burger the order and total price, is posted to firebase database from where we can retrieve the data.I have used axios to get and post data to firebase.

 How to run the app:- 1)clone the repo and open vs code and run "npm install" in the extracted folder.
                      2)run "sudo npm start" in the folder the web app will open in your default browser
